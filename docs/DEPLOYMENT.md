# Deployment Guide

## Recommended hosting path

Use the current frontend as a static app for previews, and keep the final production deployment on a VM or container host.

- `Vercel`: best choice for quick previews and stakeholder reviews
- `GitHub Pages`: acceptable for static demo builds
- `AWS` or `Google Cloud` VM: best final option when you need the local Mongo state API, backend services, or full control over networking

## Important limitation

The frontend can run entirely on demo data, but `frontend/NIRA-repo/server/mongo-state-api.mjs` is a Node process. Static hosts do not run that process for you.

That means:

- `Vercel` and `GitHub Pages` work well for the current dummy-data workflow
- Mongo-backed runtime persistence should move to a real backend or VM-hosted service before final production

## Vercel deployment

This repository now includes a root `vercel.json`, so Vercel can build the frontend directly from the repo root.

Steps:

1. Import the GitHub repository into Vercel.
2. Keep the default root at the repository root.
3. Add any frontend environment variables you need:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VITE_GUNA_EMR_BASE_URL`
   - `VITE_CDSS_BASE_URL`
   - `VITE_MONGO_STATE_API_URL` only if that API is hosted elsewhere
4. Deploy.

Vercel will build `frontend/NIRA-repo` and serve the SPA with route rewrites enabled.

## GitHub Pages deployment

This repository now includes `.github/workflows/frontend-pages.yml`.

Steps:

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. In GitHub, open `Settings -> Pages`.
3. Set `Source` to `GitHub Actions`.
4. Run the `Deploy Frontend to GitHub Pages` workflow manually.

Notes:

- The workflow is configured for the repository name `Networked-Intelligence-for-Real-time-Ambulatory-Care`.
- If the repository name changes, update `VITE_APP_BASE_PATH` inside `.github/workflows/frontend-pages.yml`.
- GitHub Pages is for static demos only. It should not be the final host for Mongo-backed runtime features.

## VM deployment

For AWS or Google Cloud VMs, keep the current split:

- frontend built from `frontend/NIRA-repo`
- backend services from `backend/guna_emr`
- Nginx in front of the frontend and APIs

The frontend already includes:

- `frontend/NIRA-repo/Dockerfile`
- `frontend/NIRA-repo/nginx.conf`

Suggested VM flow:

1. Build the frontend image or run `npm ci && npm run build`.
2. Serve the built `dist` folder through Nginx.
3. Run the Mongo state API as a separate Node service if you still need it.
4. Point `VITE_GUNA_EMR_BASE_URL`, `VITE_CDSS_BASE_URL`, and `VITE_MONGO_STATE_API_URL` to real service URLs.

## Pre-deploy check

Before every deploy:

```powershell
cd frontend/NIRA-repo
npm ci
npm run build
```
